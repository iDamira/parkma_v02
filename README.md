PARKMA

App name: PARKMA

Concept:

Big city life may be challenging. My app is going to help drivers to save location of their parked car, that's going to be displayed on interactive google map (never loose your car again), see parking regulation rules on the block they parked (never get a parking ticket again), and set the timer to know exactly how much parking time they have left 

In addition, I may incorporate a ### PARKMA Buddy flavor, that will allow fellow drivers to pass their parking spots to each other through my app. How does it work? Easy! You see who parked in the area of your interest, you see when they will leave the spot, you book it and take it when the other driver leaves!

User Story:

When the user first opens up the app he will be offered to signup and to submit his personal info, including the type of car he's driving, he can choose from three options: Sedan, Mini or SUV from a drop-down menu. Then he will be taken to the page rendering his geo position on Google Maps, and he will be able to see parking regulation rules for the block where he wants to park. After user parks his car, he'll be given a choice to save his car's location, so he can easily find it. Also, he will be given a choice to set a timer, that will count down the time he has left before parking meter time runs down.

PARKMA Buddy addition will render to the map all the users, using PARKMA(p) app in the area of interest, and the time they are planning to occupy the parking space. They will be able to book the parking spot and after the first driver leaves their parking spot, they will be there in the right place and at a right time to take the parking spot right after one leave.
